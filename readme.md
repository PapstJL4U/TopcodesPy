# TopCodes Lib in Python

# Origin
The TopCodes are based on Michael Horns Java Implementation.
source: [TopCodes](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~mhorn/topcodes/)

# Modification
I changed the Java code slightly to be able to debug and compare it to
my own Python implementation.

# Performance
It works, but it works slow. I am still figuring out how to optimize all of it.
